## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains two implementations of a **Data Warehouse from Scratch**:
1. **SQL-based Data Warehouse** using **Databricks SQL**.
2. **PySpark-based Data Warehouse** leveraging **Spark for big data processing**.

Both implementations demonstrate **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, schema design, and performance optimization** using Databricks.

Additionally, this repository includes the **Data Warehouse Concepts** document, which provides a deep dive into the fundamental principles of data warehousing, architecture, ETL processes, and key methodologies.
